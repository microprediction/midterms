# midterms

Pre-election hypothesis: That the PredictIt prices for state races, adjusted for longshot using exponent 1.15, and re-normalized, prove to be more accurate probabilities than the 538 Election model. See [The Signal and the Nate](https://www.microprediction.com/blog/longshot) for further explanation. 

I bid this hypothesis at $0.55 against either Brier score or likelihood. But let's just fix on the former if there are no takers. 

The data directory contains model and market prices frozen on the morning of the midterms.
